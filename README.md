# Emerging-Technologies-Assessment
Train a model that recognises hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset and Python packages: Kera , Flask and Jupyter. Allow the user to draw a digit using their mouse or touchscreen device.

### Installing

A step by step example on how to run

Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/ethanhorrigan/Emerging-Technologies-Assessment.git
```

Change directory

```
cd Emerging-Technologies-Assessment
```

Change directory to model folder

```
cd Model
```

Set the Flask App

```
set FLASK_APP=FlaskServer.py
```

Run the Flask App

```
flask run
```

Navigate to the browser & use this link

## Research

### Training
- Batch: Total number of training samples present per gradient update
- Epoch:The number of iterations when an ENTIRE dataset is passed forward and backward through the neural network only ONCE.
- Fit: Another word for train
